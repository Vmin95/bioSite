"I want to work again soon so I can finish paying off my house but also being able to go on a vacation would be nice. Also living healthier and maybe losing a few pounds would be nice. I want to live healthier for now because I’m getting older and with age comes illness. I want to avoid getting any illness that will incapacitate me for as long as I possibly can. So I’m going to start exercising and eating healthier foods. There really isn't much else to accomplish for me maybe retiring when I am finally be able to but.. then i think about doing nothing and then I start to think I'll be bored." -Eloisa Diaz
