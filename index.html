	<h3><div class="project_intro">This is the bioSite project. Starring Eloisa Diaz who is my mother and it felt fitting with Mother's Day on the way.  She has done so much for me and my siblings. She is someone i appreciate to have healthy and whole after an incident last year around this time that was the reason for me to fail this course previously. I stepped back to help her in her time of need by preparing meals and helping around the house. If anyone is concerned she is back to her usual self arguing and being the ball of energy we recognize.</div></h3>
